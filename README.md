Hello world! I am Wayne, a graduate student at California State University, East Bay studying computer science since 2020. Through my education, I possess extensive experience in the development of applications using C++ and Java for various purposes, including board games (including design for player AI), Reddit-like social app on android, and many more. My study mainly focuses on program design on PC (C++), Android app development (Java), algorithms, and AI design. 

Before coming to CSUEB, I used to work as a full-time actuarial analyst. During this time, I have worked on various product development projects that sold for more than 4 million USD combined. My primary tasks are: design/negotiate product structures with different departments, calculating optimal premiums and benefits for clients (Excel VBA), estimating the expense for the company, composing filing documents for the competent authority, and more.

I LOVE to play video games during my free time (RPGs, board games, strategy games). Hanging around with friends and playing games together is my favorite thing to do in my life.

I will be finishing my master's degree in Dec.2022. So I am actively looking for a software engineering internship opportunity in tech companies or video game studios. Thank you for being interested in my profile.
