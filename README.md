Hello worldðŸ‘‹, I am Wayne YN Wei, a graduate student at California State University, East Bay studying computer science since 2020. Through my education, I possess extensive experience in the development of applications using C++ and Java for various purposes, including board games, simple command-line shell programs, full-stack Reddit-like social app on android, and many others. My study mainly focuses on program design on PC (C++), Android app development (Java), algorithms, and machine learning. 

Before coming to CSUEB, I used to work as an actuarial analyst at Taiwan Life Insurance Co., Ltd. During this time, I have worked on various product development projects that sold for more than 4 million USD combined. The primary task for me is to handle calculation tasks such as finding the optimal premiums and benefits for our clients, estimated the expense for our company, and many other important measures through Excel VBA. The unique experience not only further developed my program designing principles but also trained my problem-solving skills.

I am currently looking for a software engineering (back-end) internship opportunity in a tech company. Thank you for being interested in my profile.
