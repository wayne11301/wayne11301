Hello world! I am Wayne, a graduate student at California State University, East Bay studying computer science since 2020. Through my education, I possess extensive experience in the development of applications using C++ and Java for various purposes, including board games (including design for player AI), Reddit-like social app on android, and many more. My study mainly focuses on program design on PC (C++), Android app development (Java), algorithms, and AI design. 

Before coming to CSUEB, I used to work as a full-time actuarial analyst. During this time, I have worked on various product development projects that sold for more than 4 million USD combined. My primary tasks are: design/negotiate product structures with different departments, calculating optimal premiums and benefits for clients (Excel VBA), estimating the expense for the company, composing filing documents for the competent authority, and more.

I will be finishing my master's degree in Dec.2022. So I am actively looking for a software engineering internship or full-time opportunity in tech companies. Thank you for being interested in my profile.
