 Hello world ðŸ‘‹, this is Yi-Nong Wei, I am a CS graduate student at CSUEB. I used to work as an actuarial analyst at Taiwan Life Insurance Co., Ltd, a medium-sized insurance company in Taiwan. My previous work content mainly focuses on Investment-Link insurance product development and pricing, review selling or other product-related documents (such as DM, magazine articles, and Excel proposals), write insurance product instruction manual, and prepare the filing documents for competent authority. 

Right now, I am currently studying Computer Science at California State University, East Bay, mainly focusing on program design on PC and android (C++/java), algorithms, and machine learning. The most desired future job position for me is game designer that works on game mechanics, enemy AI, and game balancing. Since I have a strong background in mathematics and statistics (that is basically what actuarial science is), I believe I can be a good asset to any game company. Finally, I am currently looking for an internship in the related area.
