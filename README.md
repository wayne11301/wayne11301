Hello worldðŸ‘‹, this is Yi-Nong Wei, I am a CS graduate student at CSUEB with a 4.0 GPA at this moment.

I used to work as an actuarial analyst at Taiwan Life Insurance Co., Ltd, a medium-sized insurance company in Taiwan. My previous work content mainly focuses on insurance product development, pricing, review selling or other product-related documents (such as DM, magazine articles, and Excel proposals), write insurance product instruction manual, and prepare the filing documents for competent authority.

Right now, I am studying Computer Science at California State University, East Bay. My main study focus is program design on PC and android (C++/java), algorithms, and machine learning. Since I have a strong background in mathematics and statistics, I believe I can be a good asset to any tech companies. Finally, I am actively looking for an internship in the related area.
